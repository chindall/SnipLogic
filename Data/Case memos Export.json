     "text": "Partnered woman, EWI from Guatemala without permanent bar. Has 3 USC children, one of whom has ADHD, anxiety, and learning disability with seemingly very intensive services.  \nHas very good DV/gender/unprotected child asylum case. The DV was somewhat limited (1 month) but was very intense. She was also raped by an adult cousin.  \n\nPartner has 2 recent DUIs. I explained he would be barred from COR.\n\nScope: Affirmative asylum (prep and file complete application, then get EAD, but not mandamus or interview prep/rep).\n\nAttorney: KMC\nLT: Lucina\n\nLucina, please do the following:\n\n1-Ensure client is set up, and matter is set up. Note partner is NOT a client.\n\n2-Prepare pp. 1-4 from I-589, and page 8 re trips back to Mexico, using Jotform questionnaire for asylum (or typeform if this has been migrated).  \n\n3-Schedule TELA appointment for forms prep. Tell her this may  be reschedled if we do not receive questionnaire in time.\n\nDuring this appointment, sight translate pp.1-4 and ask any needed follow up questions.  \n\nFollowing your portion, hand off client to me and I will prepare pp. 5+  \n\n4-Send I-589, G-28, and I-765 for each client.  Ensure we have received passports, birth certificate of client and children, marriage certificate, and 6 passport photos for each.\n\n5-Meanwhile, I will prepare a case planning/case advisal letter for asylum and cancellation cases. This has a broad case overview, notes important info, and also will identify more specific evidence we need.  For example, it discusses work permits, in absentia deportation order, social security, medical insurance.\n\nOnce we send this there will need to be some follow up appointment with you to confirm we are moving forward to obtain all these documents.\n\n6-While I am working on case plan, I will delegate to you to prepare the declaration.   \n\n7-When draft decla is ready, I will review and call client to ask follow up questions if  needed.  Once complete, I will delegate translation of the declaration.  Then, I'll delegate to you to send the declaration to client for review and schedule an appointment to discuss revisions with client/confirmation of declaration and then ensure we get signature.\n\n8-Once client has signed declaration, I will email psychologist Dr. Luis Perez a copy, background, and any supporting evidence such as prior mental health records, kids records, etc, and request a psych eval.\n\n9-When draft evaluation is received, Kevin will review it and compare to the client's declaration to note (1) any new info and (2) any apparent inconsistencies.  Once resolved, Kevin will ask for signed version.\n\n10-Once I-589 forms, basic ID dox, additional specific evidence, declaration, pscyh eval, and country conditions are received, we will mail file the application with USCIS by priority mail.  NOTE THIS MUST BE FILED BY 6 MONTHS AFTER THECONSULTATION AND THIS DATE IS ON STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. WE SHOULD ADD A CALENDAR EVENT FOR THESE CASES DUE DATES.  \n\nThe asylum packet needs to have an original and then one copy for each additional family member. The signature page needs to have 1 passport photo of client or the family member.  When preparing these, we can assemble the PDF digitally and when mailing out carefully confirm that it is a complete digital copy of the entire packet being mailed.\n\n11 - Once I-589 is filed, a 150 day waiting period begins for a work permit, which needs to be noted on the calendar.  Also, clients will need to be fingerprinted and return evidence to us.  Paralegal should schedule an appointment for 6 months after filing to ensure we have filed the EAD apps and clients have received EAD, and for me to check in. But clients needs to be informed to call if they have questions before this.  Also, EAD renewal date needs to be calendared.  \n\n12 - Once asylum interview is scheduled, Will needs to schedule a testimony prep appointment 2 weeks before and ensure we have an interpreter (KMC has referrals and will put in Clio)\n\nThanks!!!",
